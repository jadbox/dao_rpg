## üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Overview 

DAO RPG is a new kind of chat-based RPG where the game interacts with a chat group via the DAO RPG game bot. The game is designed to be collaborative and celebrate the spirit of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations.

## Basic Mechanics
* MUD-inspired interaction
* Integrates with discussion platforms (Telegram, Rocket Chat, Discord, Slack, etc)
* Inspired and integratable with DAOs, starting with the 1UP game economy
* Clan/Co-op banking and organization mechanics
* User controlled world expansion

## User Interaction

* The interaction model is driven by chatbots. In theory the game could also have it‚Äôs own website that uses the same API that the chatbots use to interact with the game.
* MUD-like interaction where the UI is text only (like Zork), with perhaps aided by pictures and animated gifs (depending on chatbot support)
* Game sessions are broken into short 5-10m long quests that will have a couple encounters and a boss fight to complete.
